# The Fat Finder Apache 2.x module.
#
# Load an Apache 2.2.x  module (and only load it.)

<IfModule !mod_ff.c>
    LoadModule	ff_module	/usr/libexec/apache2/mod_ff.so
</IfModule>


# Fat Finder requires that the "proc" pseudo-filesystem (on Linux) be mounted
# (typically at "/proc") or the "linprocfs" pseudo-filesystem on FreeBSD be
# mounted at "/compat/linux/proc")
#
# This module has a somewhat simplified concept of a session - there's a number
# of tuning values for determining a session, such as using source TCP Ports 
# (disabled by default due to Apache's scheme of passing connection file descriptors
# between children), and the use of a nameable session cookie.
#
# As sessions also use the 'source ip address', it's possible to select alternate
# sources for that 'source ip address' such as the first (or last) HTTP header value
# such as "x-Forwarded-for" (where the values are separated by commas.)
# Alternately, environment variables set by other modules can be used for the 'source ip address'
#
# Note: The 'source ip address' described here has NO effect on other parts of Apache.
#
#
# OS/X, AIX, and Solaris are not (yet) supported.  
#
# Directives:
#
# FFCheckOverhead [on|OFF] - Same as FFCHECKOVERHEADREQUEST, FFCHECKOVERHEADIDLE,
#				and FFCHECKOVERHEADCHILD all together
# FFCheckOverheadRequest [on|OFF] - Use 'getrusage()' to determine the request 
#				overhead of mod_ff.c (note: Some systems don't fully
#				populate the structure returned by getrusage() .)
# FFCheckOverheadIdle [on|OFF] - Use 'getrusage()' to determine the idle overhead
#				of mod_ff.c
# FFCheckOverheadChild [on|OFF] - Use 'getrusage()' to determine the total
#				(per. child) overhead of mod_ff.c
# FFCheckOverheadSession [on|OFF] - Use 'getrusage()' to determine the total
#				(per. child) overhead of mod_ff.c
#
# FFCleanup [on|OFF]   - Release /proc/self/.. file descriptors agressively.
#
# FFDumpEnv [on|OFF] - Flood error logs with GET/POST value pairs (if on).  Crude request debugging.
#
# FFDumpHeaders [on|OFF] - Flood error logs with request headers (if on).  Crude request debugging.
#
# FFEnable [on|OFF]    - Turn on / off mod_ff processing for this vhost/file/directory

#
# FFIgnoreStatus [NONE|connection-drops|<status_code>|-<status_code>
#  				- Ignore requests having a particular status code,
#				  or remove a particular status code from being
#				  ignored (for FF processing)
#
# FFRemoteIPSource [NONE|@remote_ip|$<environ_variable>|+<http_header_first_value>|
#				-<http_header_last_value>]
#			  - How to determine 'remote ip address' (see above)
#			  - Involved in 'session' management.
#
# FFLabel   <word>	  - Arbitrary word for labeling logs  
#
# FFLogMain [on|OFF]	  - Turn off additional logging (somewhat problematic)
#
# FFLoopback [ON|off]  - (deprecated due to "internal" tracking.)
#
# FFRemoteTCPPort [on|OFF] - Turn on/off use of requestor's TCP Port as part
# 		  	   of session management.
#
# FFInternal [on|OFF]	- Whether to ignore 'internal' requests Apache seems to
# 	     		generate for book-keeping purposes.
#
# FFDebugConfig [on|OFF] - Debug configuration management & inheritance.
#
# FFDebugProcInfo [on|OFF] - Debugging of underlying 'procinfo' routines
# 		  	 that scan /proc/self/ for data.

# 		  	   part of session management.
#

# FFSessionCookieName [NONE|<string>] - A cookie to use for 'session' management.
#
# FFResetExit [all|request|idle|child] - Reset FFExit<xx> thresholds.
#
# FFResetWarn [all|request|idle|child] - Reset FFWARN<xx> thresholds.
#
# FFProcFs  <pathname> - Provide alternative for "/proc"
#				 (or "/compat/linux/proc" on FreeBSD)
#		Note:	    "/proc"  is used because Linux kernels don't
#			    fully implement 'getrusage()'"	
#  
# FFSuppressChildOverhead <count> - When "child overhead" doesn't change, 
#				don't log this many consecutive ones 
#
# FFTimefmt <string>	    - strftime string format for when time values
#				 exceed 1 year, defaults to '%c'
#   
# FFVerbose [on|OFF]	    - Display all counters & thresholds, not just non-zero.
#
# FFWatch   [on|OFF]	    - Same as FFWATCHREQUEST, FFWATCHIDLE, FFWATCHCHILD together.
#
# FFWatchRequest [on|OFF]  - Log counters (see below <item>s) on a per-request basis
#
# FFWatchIdle [on|OFF]   - Log counters (see below <item>s) on a idle transitions.
#
# FFWatchChild [on|OFF]    - Log counter per. child rtotals (see below <item>s).
#
# FFMaxRequestsPerChild <number> - Exit after this many requests (like core config)
#
# FFMaxRequestsPerSession <number> - Exit after this many requests on a session

# 		   http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man5/proc.5.html
#
# For the following directives, <item> can be one of:

#			      /proc/[pid]/fd  - excluding "." and ".."
#    tick		  - Wall clock time from 'time(NULL)' (seconds)
#
# 'tick' can have the suffices "s" or "seconds", "m", "min", "minute", or "minutes",
#  	    "h", "hour", or "hours", "d", "day", or "days", "w", "week", or "weeks".  I.e.:
#	    	 1day
#
# The other values can have suffices of:
# 	    "k" (1024), "K" (1000), "m" (1024*1024), "M" (1000000), "g" (1024*1024*1024),
#	    		 "G" (1000000000)
#
#	Don't use these for "fds" - it doesn't make sense.

#  
# FFWarnRequest <item> <value>	
# 		 This warns if the "item" changes by "value" (or more) between the begining
#		      of the request and the end of the request.
#  
# FFExitRequest <item> <value>
# 		 This causes the child process to be terminated of the "item" increases by
#		      "value" (or more) between the begining of the request and the end.
#
# FFWarnChild	<item> <value>
# 		This warns if the "item" exceeds "value" between when the child is originally initialized and
#		the end of the request.
#
# FFExitChild	<item> <value>
# 		This causes the child process to be terminated if the increase in "item" exceeds "value" between
#		the initialization of the child process and the end of the request.
#		
# FFWarnIdle	<item> <value>
# 		This warns if the "item" changes by "value" (or more) while the child process is between requests.
#
# FFExitIdle <item> <value>
# 		This causes the child process to be terminated of the increase in "item" exceeds "value" while the
#		child process is idle.
#
#		
# FFWarnSession	<item> <value>
# 		This warns if the "item" changes by "value" (or more) while the child process is between requests for the same 'session'
#
# FFExitSession <item> <value>
# 		This causes the child process to be terminated of the increase in "item" exceeds "value" over the life 
#		of the child process 'session'
#
