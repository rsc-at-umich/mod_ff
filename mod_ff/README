mod_ff (The Fat Finder Module) is an an Apache 2.x module
suitable for monitoring the growth of Apache child processes.
It also offers the possibility of terminating "overlarge" Apache child
processes (at the end of the HTTP/HTTPS request.)

It is intended to help large scale shared virtual hosting operations 
to prevent one web site from consuming excessive resources (in particular, VM)
for extensive periods of time by allowing requests to run to completion but
then be cleaned up by the normal Apache / Unix process termination cleanup.

resources can be monitored or identified by:

Virtual memory (vmsize or rss)
CPU time (either system/kernel or user)
page faults (major or minor, or even by sub-children of the Apache process)
File descriptor counts

See the file "load_mod_ff" for more details.

There is also a companion utility "procinfo" that displays the kind of information
named here.

This is designed for Linux systems with a "/proc" filesystem.  Some support for
FreeBSD is available, but has not been extensively tested.

This software is nearly complete, except for the install target on the Makefile (sorry.)

To build/install:

./configure

make

# Then, by hand, copy "./libs/libmod_ff.so.0.0.0" to where you want the Apache module
# to be installed as, such as "/usr/libexec/apache2/mod_ff.so", etc.

# The "./procinf" program can be installed or not as you see fit. It's not especially
# usefull as it just replicates better functionality in "top" and "ps".

The file "load_mod_ff" contains example Apache configuration directives to load the
module and comments about what each of the directives offers.
